# Task-04: Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics or brands. Using Twitter data, the goal is to extract insights regarding how users feel about different entities (companies, products, topics) by applying sentiment analysis techniques.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis)
- **Description**: The dataset contains tweets, entities mentioned in those tweets, and sentiment scores/labels related to those entities.

### Dataset Features:

- `entity_type`: Type of entity (company, person, etc.)
- `text`: Tweet content
- `sentiment`: Labeled sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative)
- `confidence`: Confidence score of sentiment classification

## 🧠 Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing of tweet text.
- Conduct sentiment analysis using machine learning/NLP techniques.
- Visualize sentiment distribution across different entities.
- Identify trending entities with positive or negative public sentiment.
- Build interactive visual dashboards (optional).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- NLTK / SpaCy for text processing
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for static visualizations
- Plotly / Streamlit / Dash for interactive visualizations (optional)
